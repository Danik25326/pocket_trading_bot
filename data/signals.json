      "reason": "RSI is approaching oversold levels, MACD histogram is negative and the MACD line is below the signal line, price is trading below both EMA9 and EMA21, Bollinger Bands are tightening with price near the upper band and starting to turn down, Stochastic has crossed down from overbought territory, and recent candles show a bearish pattern (lower closes despite occasional small rallies). These factors together suggest a short‑term down move for the next 3 minutes.",
