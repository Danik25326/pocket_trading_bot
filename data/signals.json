      "reason": "EMA9 (≈221.55) is below EMA21 (≈221.60) indicating a short‑term downtrend. Stochastic is above 80 and turning down, suggesting overbought conditions. MACD histogram has been shrinking and the line is below the signal, reinforcing bearish momentum. Price is near the upper Bollinger Band and showed a bearish candle at 14:15 followed by only a weak bullish candle at 14:16, indicating limited upside. RSI is around 58, still in neutral‑to‑overbought range. Combined with low volatility (0.17%) the setup favors a short‑term sell for the next 3 minutes.",
