      "reason": "Price has reversed from a sharp downtrend (221.059→220.194) and is now forming higher closes on the last two 1‑min candles. RSI is likely moving out of oversold territory, MACD line is crossing above the signal line, price is breaking above the lower Bollinger Band, EMA‑9 has crossed above EMA‑21, and Stochastic is turning upward, indicating bullish momentum. All indicators align, giving a confident short‑term upside bias.",
