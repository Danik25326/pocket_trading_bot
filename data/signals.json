      "reason": "Recent candles show a clear upward momentum after a short pull‑back. EMA9 is above EMA21 and both are sloping upward. RSI is around 62, indicating bullish strength without being overbought. MACD line sits above the signal line with a growing positive histogram. Price is trading in the upper half of the Bollinger Bands but remains inside them. Stochastic %K is above %D (~78), approaching overbought yet supporting the uptrend. A bullish engulfing pattern appears at 11:28‑11:30. Combined, these signals give a strong bullish bias with ~82% confidence.",
