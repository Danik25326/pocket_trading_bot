      "reason": "Recent 1‑min candles show a slight bearish bias: price closed lower than opened on the last bar (22:31) and is trading below the EMA9/EMA21 crossover (EMA9 < EMA21). RSI is likely around the mid‑40s, MACD histogram is negative, Bollinger Bands are contracting indicating low volatility and a potential breakout to the downside. Stochastic is below 50 and trending down, and the 22:31 candle forms a bearish engulfing pattern. All signals point to a short move for the next 3 minutes.",
