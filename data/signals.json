      "reason": "Price is trading just above EMA9 and EMA9 is above EMA21, indicating a mild uptrend. RSI is around the mid‑50s (neither overbought nor oversold) and MACD histogram is slightly positive, supporting bullish momentum. Bollinger Bands show price near the middle band with a slight bias toward the upper band. Stochastic is in the 60‑70 range, not yet overbought. Recent candles show a strong bullish candle at 21:29 followed by a small bearish candle, suggesting continuation rather than reversal. Overall technical picture points to a short‑term upward move.",
