RSI is estimated around 48‑49 (just below the neutral 50), MACD histogram is negative, and price is touching the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting limited upside.

EMA 9 is above EMA 21, MACD histogram is positive and the line is above the signal, indicating upward momentum. RSI (≈65) confirms strength while Stochastic is above 80 (overbought but no divergence). Price sits near the upper Bollinger Band yet continues to climb, and no bearish reversal candlestick pattern appears. These factors give a confident short‑term uptrend for the next 3 minutes.",
