MACD histogram has been shrinking and the line is below the signal, reinforcing bearish momentum. Price is near the upper Bollinger Band and showed a bearish candle at 14:15 followed by only a weak bullish candle at 14:16, indicating limited upside. RSI is around 58, still in neutral‑to‑overbought range. Combined with low volatility (0.17%) the setup favors a short‑term sell for the next 3 minutes.",
