      "reason": "Price shows a slight bullish bias: EMA9 is above EMA21, MACD histogram is marginally positive, RSI is around 55‑60, Stochastic is near 70, and the last candle (10:11) forms a bullish engulfing after a small pull‑back. Bollinger Bands indicate price near the upper band but not extreme, supporting a short‑term upside move. Confidence meets the 75% minimum.",
