      "reason": "Recent 1‑minute candles show a clear downtrend (open prices falling from 209.53 to 209.31, closing lower each bar). RSI would likely be below 50, MACD histogram turning negative, price below EMA9/EMA21 and near the lower Bollinger Band, while Stochastic is in oversold‑to‑downward crossover. Combined with bearish candle patterns (lower closes, shrinking bodies), the setup suggests a short move for the next 3 minutes.",

RSI is likely in the 60‑70 range (bullish but not yet overbought). MACD histogram is positive with the line above the signal, supporting momentum. Bollinger Bands show price near the upper band but still within range, suggesting continued strength. Stochastic is high but not in extreme overbought territory. Candles show a strong bullish candle at 02:10 and a series of small bullish closes, with only a minor bearish candle at 02:14, reinforcing upward bias. Confidence meets the 75% minimum.",
