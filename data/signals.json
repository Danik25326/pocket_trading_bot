EMA‑9 is above EMA‑21, MACD histogram is positive, RSI is around 62 % (bullish but not extreme), price is touching the upper Bollinger Band while staying above the middle band, and Stochastic is in the 78‑84 % range indicating momentum. Combined with a bullish candle pattern (several higher closes and a recent bullish engulfing), the setup suggests a short‑term up move with confidence above 75 %.",
