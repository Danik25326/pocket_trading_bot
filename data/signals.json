      "reason": "EMA9 (≈158.48) is below EMA21 (≈158.52) indicating a short‑term downtrend; MACD histogram remains negative and the signal line is above the MACD line, supporting bearish momentum. RSI is around 48‑50, showing no overbought pressure but slight bearish bias. Price is touching the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting limited upside. Recent candles show a series of lower closes (10:44‑10:50) with only a small bullish reversal at 10:51, reinforcing a short‑term downside bias. Volatility is low (0.08%), so a brief 3‑minute sell trade aligns with the current micro‑trend.",
