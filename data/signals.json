EMA9 is below EMA21, MACD line is under the signal line with negative histogram, RSI is around 40 indicating bearish momentum, and price is touching the lower Bollinger Band suggesting oversold conditions. A bearish engulfing candle at 17:48 reinforces downside bias. Overall technical picture points to a short move for the next 3 minutes.",
