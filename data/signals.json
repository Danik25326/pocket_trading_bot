      "duration": 3,
      "reason": "Recent 8‑minute candles show a gradual decline (price fell from 158.819 to 158.712). Majority of bars are bearish, with a doji at 17:03 indicating weakening momentum. RSI (≈48) is near neutral but slightly below 50, MACD histogram is marginally negative, and price is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting pressure to the downside. EMA‑9 is below EMA‑21, confirming a short‑term downtrend. Stochastic is below 50 and turning down, reinforcing bearish bias. Overall low volatility (0.09%) supports a short‑term continuation of the down move.",
