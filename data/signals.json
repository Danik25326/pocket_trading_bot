MACD histogram turned positive and the line crossed above the signal, indicating bullish momentum. RSI (≈68) is approaching overbought but still supports upward pressure. Bollinger Bands show price near the upper band, confirming strength. Stochastic %K (~82) above %D (~78) shows bullish divergence. A bullish engulfing candle at 12:16 reinforces the move. All indicators align, giving a confidence above 75%.",
